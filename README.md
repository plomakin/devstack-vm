# Neutron-enabled DevStack in a Vagrant VM with Ansible

This repository contains a Vagrantfile and an accompanying Ansible playbook
that sets up a VirtualBox virtual machine that installs [DevStack][4].

The accompanying `localrc` file configures OpenStack to use Neutron (OpenStack
Networking). It also disables security groups.

This project was inspired by Brian Waldon's [vagrant_devstack][1] repository.


## Prereqs

Install the following applications on your local machine first:

 * [VirtualBox][5]
 * [Vagrant][2] 1.3.3 or greater
 * [Ansible][3]

If you want to try out the OpenStack command-line tools once DevStack is running, install the following Python packages:

  * python-novaclient
  * python-neutronclient

The easiest way to install the Python packages is with pip:

    sudo pip install python-novaclient python-neutronclient

[5]: http://virtualbox.org


## Boot the virtual machine and install DevStack

Grab this repo, set the permissions on the vagrant ssh key, and do a `vagrant
up`, like so:

    git clone https://github.com/lorin/devstack-vm
    cd devstack-vm
    chmod 0600 id_vagrant
    vagrant up

The `vagrant up` command will:

 1. Download an Ubuntu 13.04 (raring) vagrant box if it hasn't previously been downloaded to your machine.
 2. Boot the virtual machine (VM).
 3. Clone the DevStack git repository inside of the VM.
 4. Run DevStack inside of the VM.
 5. Add eth2 to the br-ex bridge inside of the VM to enable floating IP access from the host machine.

It will take at least ten minutes for this to run, and possibly much longer depending on your internet connection and whether it needs to download the Ubuntu vagrant box.

## Allow VMs to connect to the internet (Linux hosts only)

By default, VMs started by OpenStack will not be able to connect to the
internet. If you want your VMs to connect out, and you are running Linux
as your host operating system, you must configure your host machine to do
network address translation (NAT).

To enable NAT, issue the following commands in your host, as root:

```
echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward
iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o eth0 -j MASQUERADE
```


## Troubleshooting

### Authentication or permission failure

If you see an error like this:

```
devstack | FAILED => Authentication or permission failure. In some cases, you may have been able to authenticate and did not have permissions on the remote directory
```

Then you may have incorrect file permissions in the id_vagrant file. Make sure it is only readable by the owner, by doing:

    chmod 0600 id_vagrant

### Fails to connect

You may ocassionally see the following error message:

```
[default] Waiting for VM to boot. This can take a few minutes.
[default] Failed to connect to VM!
Failed to connect to VM via SSH. Please verify the VM successfully booted
by looking at the VirtualBox GUI.
```

If you see this, retry by doing:

    vagrant destroy --force && vagrant up


## Logging in the virtual machine

The VM is accessible at 192.168.27.100

You can use ssh to access it using `vagrant` as username and password, or use the
provided `id_vagrant` private key to avoid typing a password.

You can also type `vagrant ssh` to start an ssh session.

Note that you do not need to be logged in to the VM to run commands against the OpenStack endpoint.




## Loading OpenStack credentials

From your local machine, to run as the demo user:

    source demo.openrc

To run as the admin user:

    source admin.openrc

## Horizon

* URL: http://192.168.27.100
* Username: admin or demo
* Password: password


## Initial networking configuration

![Network topology](topology.png)


DevStack configures an internal network ("private") and an external network ("public"), with a router ("router1") connecting the two together. The router is configured to use its interface on the "public" network as the gateway.

## Launch a cirros instance and attach a floating IP.

Source the credentials of the "demo" user and boot an instance.

    source demo.openrc
    nova keypair-add --pub-key ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub mykey
    nova boot --flavor m1.nano --image cirros-0.3.1-x86_64-uec --key-name mykey cirros

Once the instance has booted, get its ID.

    nova list

    +--------------------------------------+--------+--------+---------------------------------+
    | ID                                   | Name   | Status | Networks                        |
    +--------------------------------------+--------+--------+---------------------------------+
    | b24fc4ad-2d66-4f28-928b-f1cf78075d33 | cirros | ACTIVE | private=10.0.0.3                |
    +--------------------------------------+--------+--------+---------------------------------+

Use the instance ID to get its neutron port :

    neutron port-list -c id -- --device_id b24fc4ad-2d66-4f28-928b-f1cf78075d33

    +--------------------------------------+
    | id                                   |
    +--------------------------------------+
    | 02491b08-919e-4582-9eb7-f8119c03b8f9 |
    +--------------------------------------+


Use the neutron port ID to create an attach a floating IP to the "public"" network:

    neutron floatingip-create public --port-id 02491b08-919e-4582-9eb7-f8119c03b8f9

    Created a new floatingip:
    +---------------------+--------------------------------------+
    | Field               | Value                                |
    +---------------------+--------------------------------------+
    | fixed_ip_address    | 10.0.0.3                             |
    | floating_ip_address | 172.24.4.227                         |
    | floating_network_id | 5770a693-cfc7-431d-ae29-76f36a2e63c0 |
    | id                  | 480524e1-a5b3-491f-a6ee-9356fc52f81d |
    | port_id             | 02491b08-919e-4582-9eb7-f8119c03b8f9 |
    | router_id           | 0deb0811-78b0-415c-9464-f05d278e9e3d |
    | tenant_id           | 512e45b937a149d283718ffcfc36b8c7     |
    +---------------------+--------------------------------------+

Finally, access your instance:

    ssh cirros@172.24.4.227


## Python bindings example

The included `boot-cirros.py` file illustrates how to executes all of the
above commands using the Python bindings.

Environments
===========
This repo contains Vagrant and Ansible files to deploy different environments for Dark-Knight inspections. This environments is based on devstack multi-node installation.

Installing pre-requisites

Running environment building
-----------
If you want full installation,
(for now and by default it's:
```Compute2 <-(net2)- Controller -(net1)-> Compute1```
)
run like that:
```
./run_vagrant_provision.sh
```
To run sepparate virtual machines simply run:
```
vagrant up <controller/compute1/compute2>
```
To run 2 host installation:
```
vagrant up controller compute1
```
or
```
vagrant up controller compute2
```
